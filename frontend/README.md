## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Libraries
This project was built with modern web technologies focusing on performance and elegant animations:

* **Framework:** [React 18](https://react.dev/) powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for lightning-fast HMR and building.
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS v3](https://tailwindcss.com/) for rapid utility-first styling and responsive design.
* **Animations:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) used extensively for scroll-linked physics (e.g., the dynamic resume timeline), 3D tilt-cards, and staggered component reveals.
* **Icons:** [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) for lightweight SVG scalable vector icons.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Dynamic Hero Section:** Advanced Framer-Motion animated text reveals with an elegant profile frame and integrated social contact links.
* **Animated Scroll Timeline:** A custom-built resume timeline where the central SVG path and individual capability nodes mathematically draw and illuminate themselves precisely as you scroll down the page.
* **Interactive 3D Grid:** Built a custom 3D perspective tilt-card component for the "About Me" skills grid.
* **Fully Responsive:** Beautifully gracefully collapses from a sweeping zig-zag desktop layout into a sleek mobile view.
* **Vercel Ready:** Instantly deployable continuous integration setup.
